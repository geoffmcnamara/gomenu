                        -=*[ gomenu ]*=-

PURPOSE:

This script is to satisfy two personal desires.

1.  To provide a simple and easy menu application that is
    editible on the fly, and offers item help if desired.
2.  The need for touching the top of Maslow's hierarchy 
    - self-actualization.

INSTALLATION:

* I suggest adding $HOME/bin to your path.
* Then place gmenu script into that directory (~/bin).  
* Change the mode of gmenu to executable by the user. 
	eg: chmod +x ~/bin/gomenu
* Then run gomenu.  It will create a directory called ~/.menu.
* "gomenu -h" will provide brief help
* Play with it.
	
	-- Shared Menus ---
* If you desire shared global use:
	* As root cp gomenu /usr/local
	* mkdir /usr/share/gomenu
	* gomenu -s
		This will automatically create new sample sahred menus in 
		the /usr/share/gomenu directory.
		
* Write me and tell me what you think - yes, tell me about all the
  spelling and grammer errors too.
